Hypotenuse-Java-Project
=======================

This is the repository for my Hypotenuse Java Project, a program that takes user input for a right triangle's legs, calculates the hypotenuse, and draws the triangle with labeled dimensions.

In this repository, the following will be attached:
  - the .java file for the program
  - the code for the program with comments
  - a video demonstration of some sample trials

The .java file may be downloaded and used freely, but the code as written on the .java file does not have any explanatory comments other than the header at the top. For this reason, the code has been modified in the second attachment to include informational comments that narrate the project as the code progresses. The video attachment is reference material for anyone who either does not have an IDE to run the .java file or wants quick access to a demonstration of the program.
