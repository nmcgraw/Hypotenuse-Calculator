Hypotenuse-Java-Project
=======================

This is the repository for my Hypotenuse Java Project, a program that takes user input for a right triangle's legs, calculates the hypotenuse, and draws the triangle with labeled dimensions.

In this repository, the following will be attached:
  - the Input.java class (main class)
  - the Graph.java class (supplements Input.java)
  - a copy of the code for each class with comments

The code as written on the .java files does not have any explanatory comments other than the headers at the top. For this reason, the code has been modified in separate .java files to include informational comments that narrate the project as the code progresses.
